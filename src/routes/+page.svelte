<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Liam and this is my website! This is currently just a side project and is still under development, but feel free to check back occasionally to see what's changed.</p>

<h3>Academics</h3>
<p>I recently graduated from Liberty University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I completed dual cognates in Software Engineering and Data Science as well as a minor in Mathematics. I am planning on returning to school in the (near) future to earn a graduate degree - likely a Master of Computer Science.</p>
