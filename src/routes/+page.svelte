<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Liam and this is my website! This is currently just a side project and
  is still very much under development, but feel free to check back occasionally
  to see what's changed.
</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Career</h2>
<p>
  I am currently working as a Data Scientist at BWX Technologies in Lynchburg,
  VA, where I have had the oportunity to get almost everything I ever wanted out
  of a Computer Science job. I have been reaching into all sorts of different
  fields in the realm of CS, from full-stack development to database design to
  machine learning. Granted, this position <em>is</em> supposed to be focused on
  data science, so I don't expect that level of variety to continue indefinitely.
  In order to maintain my programming skills and further my abilities as a Software
  Engineer, I am also currently searching for a remote, part-time development position.
</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>
  I graduated from Liberty University this past May with a Bachelor of Science
  in Computer Science. I completed dual concentrations in Software Engineering
  and Data Science, as well as a minor in Mathematics. I am planning on
  returning to school in the near-ish future to earn a graduate degree(s) -
  likely a Master of Computer Science (MCS) and/or a Master of Science in Data
  Science (MSDS).
</p>

<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
<p><strong>Trumpet</strong></p>
<p>
  I have played trumpet for over 13 years and was a member of my schools'
  concert and marching bands all through middle school, high school, and
  college. In 2022, I toured and competed in the DCI circuit with the Cadets
  Drum and Bugle Corps (FHNSAB), and am currently considering auditioning for
  DCA corps for the 2025 season (and beyond). Since graduating, I have continued
  to practice trumpet on my own in my spare time, but I have been searching for
  local groups to join to maintain some sense of structured playing.
</p>
<p><strong>Disc Sports</strong></p>
<p>
  During my final year at Liberty, I played club sports as a member of the
  Liberty University Men's Ultimate Frisbee team. I then tried out for and made
  the practice squad for the Lynchburg Legion Ultimate Frisbee Team this past
  season. Hopefully I'll be able to continue playing for Legion in future
  seasons and possibly even go back to school in time to get a few more years of
  collegiate play.
</p>
<p>
  I also began playing disc golf back in March of this year, and I recently had
  the chance to play in <a
    href="https://www.pdga.com/apps/tournament/live/event?eventId=84073&division=MA4"
    target="_blank">my first ever PDGA tournament</a
  >. I competed in the Mixed Amateur 4 (MA4) division and actually managed to
  place 6th out of 17 with a score of +9 through 27 holes! I had an absolute
  blast and fully intend to continue improving my game and competing in
  PDGA-sanctioned events.
